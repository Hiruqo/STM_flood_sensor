# STM_flood_sensor
The aim of the project is to build a standalone and energyefficient flooding sensor using an STM microcontroller and a WiFi module. The device should be equipped with its own power supply. The work also required the development of software to remotely monitor sensor performance and generate reports in alarm situations via a simple mobile app.
